# SnapSlider — Responsive Image Carousel
SnapSlider is a responsive and lightweight image slider built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. This project showcases image transitions with smooth animations and navigational controls (next, previous, autoplay). It's a perfect example of building a component that’s both user-friendly and visually engaging.
